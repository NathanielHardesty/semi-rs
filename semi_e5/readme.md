SECS-II is a [Presentation Layer] protocol designed to facilitate a
common communications language between semiconductor equipment,
particularly as understood by the GEM ([SEMI E30]) [Application Layer]
protocol (together known as SECS/GEM). Common [Session Layer] protocols for
transporting SECS-II messages include SECS-I ([SEMI E4]) and HSMS
([SEMI E37]).
