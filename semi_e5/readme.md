[SECS-II] is a protocol designed to facilitate a common syntactic and semantic
message structure used in communications between semiconductor equipment.

Most commonly, the [HSMS] ([SEMI E37]) or SECS-I ([SEMI E4]) protocols are used
to transmit SECS-II formatted messages.

Most commonly, the GEM ([SEMI E30]) and OSS ([SEMI E39]) protocols are used to
integrate host/equipment communication and behavior using SECS-II messages.
