## PROTOCOL MODEL

Although SEMI does not publish or correlate their protocol standards into a
particular model, an explanation of the role of each part of the protcol stack
is desirable. These considerations are taken into account:

- SEMI often produces graphics which place certain protocols in certain implied
  but unnamed layers in a protocol stack.
- The IETF model fails to provide explanatory power, as all but one SEMI
  protocol would fit entirely into its Application Layer.
- The OSI model, while appearing to be a decent fit for the SEMI standards
  which were developed in the 80s and early 90s, no longer provides an accurate
  model of SEMI's protocols.

Thusly, a bespoke model is used for SEMI's protocol stack. This model is
subject to change, as it is only provided for explanatory purposes.

1. Transaction Layer
   - Provides the reliable transmission of messages formed using bytes.
   - Provides the correlation of messages in two-way conversation into
     transactions, i.e. request/response pairs.
2. Encoding Layer
   - Provides a data syntax, the serialization of the syntax into bytes, and
     the deseralization of bytes into the syntax.
   - Provides a set of messages formed using the syntax with defined semantic
     meaning, and the way in which these messages can be used in transactions.
3. Integration Layer
   - Provides the correlation of transactions into conversations.
   - Provides the pragmatics by which the context of conversations is stored,
     accessed, and changed.
4. Operation Layer
   - Provides contexts to be manipulated for specific operational purposes,
     including the management and tracking of particular objects.

## TRANSACTION LAYER

### HIGH-SPEED SECS MESSAGE SERVICES ([HSMS])

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/semi_e37.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/semi_e37)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/semi_e37.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/semi_e37)

Based on **[SEMI E37]**, [HSMS] is a protocol designed to facilitate the
reliable transmission of messages between semiconductor equipment over TCP/IP.

### PLANNED TRANSACTION LAYER PROTOCOLS

- SEMI Equipment Communications Standard 1 Message Transfer (SECS-I) - [SEMI E4]

## ENCODING LAYER

### SEMI EQUIPMENT COMMUNICATIONS STANDARD 2 MESSAGE CONTENT ([SECS-II])

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/semi_e5.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/semi_e5)

Based on **[SEMI E5]**, [SECS-II] is a protocol designed to facilitate a common
syntactic and semantic message structure used in communications between
semiconductor equipment.
