[HSMS] is a protocol designed to facilitate the reliable transmission of
messages between semiconductor equipment over TCP/IP.

Most commonly, exchanged messages are encoded with the [SECS-II] ([SEMI E5])
protocol.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For ease of programming and extension, the functionality of the protocol
has been divided into a few subsets:

- [Primitive Services] - Manages the TCP/IP connection and the sending of
  messages with proper headers.
- [Generic Services] - Manages the sending of messages of particular types
  and at particular times as allowed by the protocol.
- Single Selected Session Services - Manages the restriction of the
  protocol to scenarios involving a single host/equipment pair in
  communication.
  - Not yet implemented.
